# Magisk Enable Mifare Classic

## How

Ideally, you should replace `system/vendor/etc/libnfc-nci.conf` with the equivalent of this file on your phone. Then, just append the last two lines, which enable the Mifare Classic Reader.

```
# Enable Mifare Classic NFC Smartcards.
LEGACY_MIFARE_READER=1
```
